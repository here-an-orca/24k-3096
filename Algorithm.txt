Algorithm-Question(1)

Ask the user to Enter the Nth-number
Ask the user to Enter the n-Number
Set a to n-number/Nth-number
If a is an integer then Set b to Nth-number/2, Else display that "Nth-number is not a divisor of n-number"
If b is an integer then display "The Nth-number is a divisor of n-number and it's even" Else "The Nth-number is a divisor of n-number and it's odd"

Question (2)

Ask the user to enter a number between 1 and 12, including 1 and 12
If the user enters 1 then display Jan
If 2 then display Feb
If 3 then display Mar
If 4 Then display April
If 5 then display May
If 6 then display Jun
If 7 then display Jul
If 8 then display Aug
If 9 then display Sep
If 10 then display Oct
If 11 then display Nov
If 12 then display Dec

Question (3)

Ask the user to enter number1
Ask the user to enter The-operator-of-number1-along-with-1-like-plusORminusORpercentage1
Ask the user to enter number2
Ask the user to enter The-operator-of-number2-along-with-1-like-plusORminusORpercentage1
Ask the user to press the Key a if He/She wants to add a multiplication or division operator between number1 and number2 along with their own plus, minus or percentage operators and b if he/she doesn't want any additional operators between them.

SET a to number1
SET b to The-operator-of-number1-along-with-1-like-plusORminusORpercentage1
SET c to number2
SET d to The-operator-of-number2-along-with-1-like-plusORminusORpercentage1
SET result to (a(b) + c(d))
SET result-1 to (a(b) ร c(d))
SET result-2 to (a(b) รท c(d))
SET result-3 to (c(d) รท a(b))

If the user pressed b then display result 

Else ask the user to specify the operator

If the user choose multiplication then display result-1

Else ask the order of division from number1 and its operator divided by number2 and its operator and vice versa

If it's number1 and its operator divided by number2 and its operator then display result-2

Else display result-3
